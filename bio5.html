       <h1><center>COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY</center></h1><br>
        <h1>Course Description:</h1><br>
        <p>This course provides a general introduction to computational tools for biology. The course is divided into two halves. The first half covers computational molecular biology and genomics. It examines important sources of biological data, how they are archived and made available to researchers, and what computational tools are available to use them effectively in research. In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. The second half covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homework requiring modification of scripts to perform computational analyses. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, and neuron behavior. The imaging component includes the basics of machine vision, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models.</p>
        <h1>Prerequisites:</h1><br>
        <p>Familiarity with Basic concepts of biology.</p>
        <h1>Course Materials:</h1><br>
        <p>Detailed handouts with references to material on the Web will be handed every week. There is no required text book.</p>
        <h1>Gradings:</h1><br>
        <p>Practically every class will be followed by a homework assignment. Grades on the solutions for class assignments constitute approximately 85% of the final grade. 15% of the grade will be earned through the final project. Final projects will be assigned/selected three weeks before the end of the class. You will produce a paper (10+ pages of MS Word text, 10+ PowerPoint Slides, a working demo, 15 minute YouTube Video of your presentation and a brief 2 minute YouTube video that might be presented to the class on the day of final presentations. Several students will be invited to present their final projects live to the entire class. 95% or higher gives you an A, 90-95% gives you an A-, 85-90% a B+, etc.</p>
