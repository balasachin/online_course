        <h1>Course Description:</h1><br>
        <p>Geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the sizes, shapes, positions angles and dimensions of things. Flat shapes like squares, circles, and triangles are a part of flat geometry and are called 2D shapes. These shapes have only 2 dimensions, the length and the width.Geometry is derived from two Greek words, geo + metron, meaning earth & measurement. Thus it is concerned with the properties and relations of points, lines, surfaces, solids, and higher dimensional analogues. We study geometry to find the Length, Area, Volume of different Plane and Solid figures which are present around us in this world and to know better about them.
