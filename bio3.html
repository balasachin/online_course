        <h1>Course Description:</h1><br>
        <p>This course explores the environment through the lens of human influence. We will discuss human behavior as it relates to the treatment and use of the environment, from a geographical perspective. We will focus on spatial dimensions of global environmental issues, which includes Earth's subsystems, population growth, land-use change, industry and uneven development, specific examples of the human footprint, and climate change.</p>
        <h1>Prerequisites:</h1><br>
        <p>Familiarity with Basic Concepts of Biology</p>
        <h1>Course Materials:</h1><br>
        <p>Detailed handouts with references to material on the Web will be handed every week. There is no required text book.</p>
        <h1>Gradings:</h1><br>
        <p>Practically every class will be followed by a homework assignment. Grades on the solutions for class assignments constitute approximately 85% of the final grade. 15% of the grade will be earned through the final project. Final projects will be assigned/selected three weeks before the end of the class. You will produce a paper (10+ pages of MS Word text, 10+ PowerPoint Slides, a working demo, 15 minute YouTube Video of your presentation and a brief 2 minute YouTube video that might be presented to the class on the day of final presentations. Several students will be invited to present their final projects live to the entire class. 95% or higher gives you an A, 90-95% gives you an A-, 85-90% a B+, etc.</p>
