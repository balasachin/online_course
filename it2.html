Final projects will be assigned/selected three weeks before the end of the class. You will produce a paper (10+ pages of MS Word text, 10+ PowerPoint Slides, a working demo, 15 minute YouTube Video of your presentation and a brief 2 minute YouTube video that might be presented to the class on the day of final presentations. Several students will be invited to present their final projects live to the entire class. 95% or higher gives you an A, 90-95% gives you an A-, 85-90% a B+, etc.</p>
