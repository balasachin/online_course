        <h1>Course Description:</h1><br>
        <p>Number theory is the study of properties of the integers. Because of the fundamental nature of the integers in mathematics, and the fundamental nature of mathematics in science, the famous mathematician and physicist Gauss wrote: "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and number theory is the queen of mathematics.The number theory helps discover interesting relationships between different sorts of numbers and to prove that these are true . Number Theory is partly experimental and partly theoretical. Experimental part leads to questions and suggests ways to answer them. The theoretical part tries to devise an argument which gives a conclusive answer to the questions.

	Here are the steps to follow:

		<ul><li> Accumulate numerical data</li>

		<li> Examine the data and find the patterns and relationship</li>

		<li> Formulate conjectures that explain the patterns and relationships</li>

		<li> Test the conjectures by collecting additional data and check whether the new information fits or not</li>

		<li> Devise an argument that conjectures are correct. All the steps are important in number theory and in mathematics. A scientific theory is an ability to predict the outcome of experiments. In mathematics one requires the step of a proof, that is, a logical sequence of assertions, starting from known facts and ending at the desired statement"</li></ul>
