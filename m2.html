        <h1>Course Description:</h1><br>
        <p>Probability means possibility. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the occurrence of a random event. The value is expressed from zero to one. Probability has been introduced in Maths to predict how likely events are to happen.
The meaning of probability is basically the extent to which something is likely to happen. This is the basic probability theory, which is also used in the probability distribution, where you will learn the possibility of outcomes for a random experiment. To find the probability of a single event to occur, first, we should know the total number of possible outcomes.

        <h1>Prerequisites:</h1><br>
        <p>If you want a basic introduction then some basic set theory (what is a set and elementary set operations), combinatorics (knowing different ways of counting, inclusion-exclusion principle) and calculus (knowing derivatives and integrals).</p>
        <h1>Course Materials:</h1><br>
        <p>Detailed handouts with references to material on the Web will be handed every week. There is no required text book.</p>
