        <h1>Course Description:</h1><br>
        <p>Governance comprises all of the processes of governing – whether undertaken by the government of a state, by a market or by a network – over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a territory or across territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an organized society.</p>
        <h1>Course Materials:</h1><br>
        <p>Detailed handouts with references to material on the Web will be handed every week. There is no required text book.</p>
        <h1>Gradings:</h1><br>
        <p>Practically every class will be followed by a homework assignment. Grades on the solutions for class assignments constitute approximately 85% of the final grade. 15% of the grade will be earned through the final project. Final projects will be assigned/selected three weeks before the end of the class. You will produce a paper (10+ pages of MS Word text, 10+ PowerPoint Slides, a working demo, 15 minute YouTube Video of your presentation and a brief 2 minute YouTube video that might be presented to the class on the day of final presentations. Several students will be invited to present their final projects live to the entire class. 95% or higher gives you an A, 90-95% gives you an A-, 85-90% a B+, etc.</p>
